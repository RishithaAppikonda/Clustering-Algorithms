# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning technique** used to group similar data points together based on their inherent characteristics. Unlike classification, clustering does not rely on labeled data; instead, it identifies patterns and structures within the dataset. Clustering is widely used in customer segmentation, image analysis, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Cluster**: A collection of data points that are similar to each other. 
- **Centroid**: The center point of a cluster (used in algorithms like K-Means).  
- **Distance/Similarity Measures**: Metrics used to determine how close or similar points are (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine similarity).    
- **Inertia/Variance**: A measure of how tightly data points are grouped within clusters.
